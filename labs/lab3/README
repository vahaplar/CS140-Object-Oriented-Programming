It consists of two programs, one for our class and other for testing our code.

Wroom Wroom!
Fuel level: 19.98

TO RUN:
By using the command "jar -xvf lab3.jar", we extract the documents in .jar file. To run, for example the second program, we simply used "java -cp target CarTester" 
command while in lab3 folder.

EXTRA CREDIT:
N/a

BIBLIOGRAPHY:
Lab Instructions and the informations given by TA

MISCELLANEOUS:
We didn't import Car class to CarTester, since they were both in the same folder. 

Because of the technical problems with servers,  I had to use "bingsuns.binghamton.edu" with the suggestion of my instructor in order to compile and archive this project.
Due to this, I had to use an earlier version of java.
