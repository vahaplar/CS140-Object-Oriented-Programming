MISCELLANEOUS:
The lock algorithm is the same algorithm that I use in my locker room at university.

Because of the technical problems with servers,  I had to use "bingsuns.binghamton.edu" with the suggestion of my instructor in order to compile and archive this project.
Due to this, I had to use an earlier version of java.
